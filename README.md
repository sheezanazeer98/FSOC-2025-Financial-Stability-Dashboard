## 🎯 Financial Stability Assessment

**Overall Status:** STABLE with ELEVATED VULNERABILITIES

Markets performed well through 2025 volatility (April episode managed without major disruption), but underlying risks persist:

1. **Record hedge fund leverage** (2.6x, up to 18x for largest) amplifies potential for forced selling
2. **Private credit growth** ($1.1T) outpacing risk management with 5.5% defaults vs 1.3% high yield
3. **CRE refinancing wall** of $936B approaching 2026 (+19% vs 2025)
4. **Student loan crisis** affecting 9M borrowers post-forbearance

Regulatory responses progressing: eSLR modified (Nov 2025), Treasury clearing mandate on track (2026-27), supervision refocused on material risks, GENIUS Act enacted (Jul 2025).
